# Background

Employees do not tend to stay in a single organization forever. It is common for a resource to seek opportunities that best suits his aspirations and in his attempt to satisfy requirements, seeks better opportunities outside current employment. However, better opportunity may also demand relocating to new places and it is difficult to find a suitable place to move with family and often results in multiple enquiries and prolonged decision making process while selecting a best neighborhood and still does not ensure satisfaction.


# Problem

This use case will center around an employee named Luke, who is currently residing in New York in the Manhattan area and has found a suitable Job opportunity in Scarborough, Toronto. He has never been to Toronto and has limited friends in that area. He is not satisfied with his research and the locations suggested to him by friends and agents. He is looking for neighborhoods similar to his current neighborhood.

Can we find neighborhoods in Toronto that are similar to Like's current area of residence?



# Data

To answer the question at hand, we would need the New York geo data pertaining to Luke's current area of residence. Additionally, to find the venues associated with his current residence, we would need to source venue data from foursquare or Google. New York geo data is available at https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. 
Similar geo data will be required to be sourced for Toronto, Scarborough. Geo data for Toronto is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M and venue category data from either foursquare or google.
